\begin{rSection}{Ongoing Projects}

{\bf Privacy and Security in the Arts} \hfill January 2018 \\ 
Artists and museums are increasingly turning to digital data as a medium. The context of art poses new challenges in data governance; while privacy preserves psychological safety, art actively disrupts it. Users don't walk into a gallery expecting a data use agreement. We focus on the case study of ``Project Amelia,'' a large-scale immersive theater production involving real technology, over 100 production team members, and over 800 audience members who contributed their social media data to the performance.


{\bf Online Interview Experiment} \hfill April 2018 \\ 
	Online interviews are a popular research tool, but are an under-studied medium of data collection. We are conducting and analyzing 150 online interviews in a large-scale online experiment to assess differences of data across 7 modes of interviewing (e.g., email vs video).


{\bf Mapping Machine Learning} \hfill July 2019 \\ 
Interdisciplinary project to map out public-facing deployments of Machine Learning in the Pittsburgh, PA area. The team includes public policy, participatory design, and computer science representation.

\begin{rSection}{A Note on Values}
I am constantly striving to make my professional and personal life adhere to a strong set of values. While I often fail, and while these values are in constant flux, they are my aspiration. As a result, I have developed a set of heurstics to guide my actions, many of which are relevant to professional spheres. I do not include these guidelines to evangelize, but to add context to my professional interactions and publicly state them a tool of accountability. \\

{\bf Flight Restrictions} \\  
In an effort to reduce my carbon footprint, I fly only once per year or in extraordinary cirumstances. \\

{\bf Funding \& Labor Restrictions} \\
As part of my committment to domestic and global nonviolence, I avoid accepting money, resources, or collaboartions from the defense, immigration enforcement, and detention industries. \\

{\bf Allocating `Free' Time} \\
I subscribe to a reparative approach to resource allocation. I generally try (though often fail) to direct my social and financial capital to disabled, Black, indigenous, or other systemically marginalized people. \\
